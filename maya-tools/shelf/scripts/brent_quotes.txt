We're in finish mode. Kay?
Go team!
This is the best film BYU has ever produced.
If winning was easy, even losers could do it.
If this film doesn't win first place at the Student Emmys, I'm going to be seriously disappointed.
If only we had used blendshapes!
But too bad you have science, and math, and religion classes, or this film would have been great.
When we were working on Lemmings...
If you are feeling discouraged, remember. It took two hours to open Noggin.
I can't wait to take credit for this film!
Kelly and I are really excited for this film.
I've been braggin you guys up to everyone I know.
It always makes me sad when I see my students selling shoes at Sears.
Do a good job, and then email me your grade!
So heres the deal. We have a couple weeks to make this thing shine!
So I just got an email from Ira...
